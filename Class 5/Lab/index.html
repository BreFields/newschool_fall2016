	<h1>The 18 universities where students get the most access to teachers</h1>

	<p>The quality of your student experience at university depends how much access you get to the teaching staff.</p>

	<p>The more professors, the more attention you and your studies will get, and the fewer students you'll have in your classes and lectures.</p>

	<p>The <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank_label/sort_order/asc/cols/rank_only">Times Higher Education's World University Ranking 2016-2017</a> includes a ranking of universities' ratios of the number of students per member of staff.</p>

	<p>The study ranks universities around the world, taking into account teaching, research, and citations of every university.</p>

	<p>Here are the best UK universities for low student numbers per teacher.</p>
